# Pure Data Bela Tutorials
A collection of Pd abstractions and patches for learning how to program Bela with Pure Data.

To run the example patches in Pure Data on your computer, add the path of the 'abstractions' folder to the Pd -> Preferences -> Path...

To run on a Bela board:
* either copy the needed abstractions to the local project folder, 
* or scp the abstractions folder to `~/Bela/Projects/pd-externals/`

Patches and audio design by Andrea Guidi and Robert Jack. Further edited and added to by Becky Stewart.

See [the Bela website](http://bela.io) for more information about working with the Bela board.
